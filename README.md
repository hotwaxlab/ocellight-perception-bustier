# ocellight-perception-bustier
Inspired by the facial features of your friendly neighborhood spider, Ocellight the Perception Bustier is an open-source wearable that manifests nearby motion through domes of illuminating ocelli on a symbolically-charged female garment. Proximity becomes light, turning personal space into something you can feel—and see.
