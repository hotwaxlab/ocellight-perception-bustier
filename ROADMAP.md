# Ocellight – Project Roadmap

**Ocellight: The Perception Bustier** is an ongoing exploration of wearable sensing, light, and personal space. This roadmap outlines our journey from prototype to platform.

---

## Phase 1 – Prototype (Current)

- Wearable proximity sensing via distributed sensors  
- LED ocelli respond to nearby movement, translating proximity into light  
- Custom PCB integrates microcontroller, sensors, controls, and LED outputs  
- Firmware maps input to output transparently, favoring immediacy and predictability  
- Safety, comfort, and wearability addressed for chest-mounted garment  

---

## Phase 2 – Expanding Sensing Modalities

- Add additional sensor types to enrich the embodied experience:
  - **Capacitive touch**: subtle hand/object detection  
  - **IR sensor**: sense live/animate objects
  - **Temperature**: sense environmental change  
  - **Motion / IMUs**: detect wearer movement or tilt for dynamic feedback  
- Explore multi-modal outputs (LED + audio + gentle haptics)  
- Iterate on garment ergonomics and sensor placement for extended wear  
- Refine output light algorithm

---

## Phase 3 – Modular Platform

- Create modular sensor arrays for experimentation with other wearables  
- Publish firmware libraries for easy adaptation to new hardware  
- Develop open tutorials and step-by-step guides  
- Enable multi-wearer or installation-based experiments  

---

## Goals

- Make embodied sensing **intuitive, playful, and legible**  
- Extend awareness of personal space through wearable interaction  
- Keep hardware approachable, open-source, and adaptable for future projects
